The app is a community platform that connects coders and programmers to share software industry trends, communicate, and solve coding doubts via a chatbot. It also includes an algorithm visualizer tool to help newbies visualize and learn complex algorithms. The app aims to provide a comprehensive platform for coders and programmers to learn, connect, and grow within the software industry.

### Technology Used
- Kotlin: Kotlin is a programming language that is widely used for developing Android applications. It is designed to be more concise, expressive, and safe than Java, which makes it easier and faster to write code.

- MVVM: MVVM is an architectural pattern used in software development that stands for Model-View-ViewModel. It is designed to separate the user interface logic from the business logic, making it easier to maintain and test the application.

- Firebase: Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Google. It offers various features such as authentication, cloud storage, database, and messaging that make it easier to build scalable and secure applications. Here I have implemented firebase realtime storage for storing data in the backend.

- OpenAI: OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. The chatbot feature in this app is made up using OpenAI, which is a powerful tool for natural language processing.

- OkHttp: OkHttp is a Java library used for making HTTP requests in Android applications. It is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, making it an ideal choice for developers who need to interact with RESTful APIs.

Overall, this app uses a combination of powerful technologies to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience for coders and programmers. The use of Kotlin and MVVM ensures that the app is easy to maintain and test, while Firebase provides a secure and scalable backend. The chatbot feature, made up using OpenAI and OkHttp, enables users to ask doubts and get responses in a natural language, making it easier to get help with coding or any other programming language and development.
